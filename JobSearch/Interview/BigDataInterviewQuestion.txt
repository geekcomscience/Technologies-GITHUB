Write code for Kafka consumer and producer ?

Write code in spark streaming say you are receiving. Employee data from Kafka (eid|ename| deptid|salary|) and you gave data of dept on CSV file (deptid|deptname) finally data should be written to some db or Kafka by replacing dept of with name. Target data should not contain dept It should have dept id. Use accumulator and broadcast variable

What is group co ordinator in Kafka ?

Say three kafka brokers are running and 3 brokers from flume is also running I have three partition .. is it suitable architecture ..may be I need to learn what is the suitable architecture for Kafka and flume ? In this case how many consumers are enough ?

I have 100 employee records employee object is there and I have list of employee objects .. I have 3 modules one module is expecting sorting by id another is expecting sorting by name and another is sorting by dept I do not want to do query wise how will you do ..how will you do it ?

=======================================
HCL round 2 interview
Say data is written to multiple partition how multiple consumers read message from partition ?

Say you have 2 consumers from 2 different consumer groups. All are reading same topic and they are reading same partition so when a new message arrived to which consumer data will go..of both read message will it have any issue

=======================================Mindtree interview
How do you rate yourself in spark and what are the things you have done in spark ?

What is executor memory in spark ? Doc Updated

How do we calculate executor memory ?

Is it per mapper ? Or is it per reducer ? Does this have any relationship with those things ?

Explain dynamic allocation in spark ..
Is it one mapper one JVM or executor like that ?

You have heard of spark lineage right like if RDD is lot we can reconstruct it what is meant by data is lost or RDD is lost mean ? How do we say data is lost or task is lost in which scenario it would happen ?

So if the task goes down then the data needs to be read from disk again ?

Can you explain how Kafka and spark work together ?

What if topic goes down ? 

How fault tolerance happens in Kafka ?

In Kafka configuration to receive some size of data ?What are Dstreams?

Checkpointing in streaming 

Do we have lazy evaluation in streaming?

On RDD if I do map operation and filter how many RDDs will be created ..? When action is performed what is that happening 

How do you clear up RDD when you have so much of RDDs
