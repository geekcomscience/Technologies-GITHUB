# Case Study 1: (this case study should support JAVA 8 and above)

We want to inspect the ledger of transactions to look for relationships between accounts.
Specifically, we want to determine if a starting account has ultimately sent funds to an ending account, perhaps through a number of intermediary accounts (with transaction details)

```
Example:
A -> B (09/09/2017)
B -> C (09/22/2017)
C -> V (09/27/2017)
```

Solution: To design appropriate JAVA or Scala classes to produce the above case study with input as source account to find the target account.

# Case Study 2: (this case study should support JAVA 8 and above)
Write a Java Program to swap two numbers without using the third variable.

```
Example:
A = 10
B = 20
After Swapping without a third variable
A = 20
B = 10
```

Solution: To design appropriate JAVA classes to produce the above case study with input as A is 10 and B is 20.
